Welcome to People's Reinforcement Learning (PRL) documentation!
================================================================

Our main goal is to build a useful tool for the reinforcement learning researchers.

While using PRL library for building agents and conducting experiments you
can focus on a structure of an agent, state transformations, neural networks
architecture, action transformations and reward shaping. Time and memory profiling,
logging, agent-environment interactions, agent state saving,
neural network training, early stopping or training visualization
happens automatically behind the scenes. You are also provided
with very useful tools for handling training history and preparing training sets for
neural networks.
